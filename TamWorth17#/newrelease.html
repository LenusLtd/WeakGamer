                    <p>Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Wildlands™ takes place in the expansive, gritty and vibrant backdrop of Bolivia, South America. The influential and vicious Santa Blanca Mexican drug Cartel has turned the country into a narco-state, leading to lawlessness, fear, injustice and violence.<br>
                    You are sent behind the enemy lines as a member of The Ghosts, a legendary US Elite Special Operations team, to create chaos that will destabilize and eventually break the alliance between the Santa Blanca cartel and the corrupted government.</p>

                    <p>While the trailer doesn't reveal as much as we might have hoped, it does give a brief and utterly gorgeous glimpse at the world that awaits us in Red Dead Redemption 2.

The sequel once again takes place in the Old West, brimming with cowboys, cattle and shanty towns filled with chaotic bars and bustling general stores. In terms of narrative the trailer is light beyond a single conclusive quote:

"Listen to me. When the time comes, you gotta run and don't look back. This is over."
The voice of these words is unknown, but in the trailer it is followed by the visual of seven men on horseback, the same gang found in the game's reveal artwork.</p>
